# Introduction to Flutter and Dart

## What is Flutter?

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It's used for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

### Key Features of Flutter:

1. **Cross-platform Development**: Write once, run on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, web, desktop).
2. **Fast Development**: Hot reload feature allows for quick iterations and updates.
3. **Expressive and Flexible UI**: Rich set of customizable widgets for building native interfaces.
4. **Native Performance**: Flutter compiles to native code for better performance.
5. **Open Source**: Large community and extensive package ecosystem.

## Dart Language Basics

Dart is the programming language used for Flutter development. It's also created by Google and is optimized for building user interfaces.

### Key Dart Features:

1. **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Dart is an object, including numbers and functions.
2. **Strongly Typed**: Dart is statically typed, but also supports type inference.
3. **Null Safety**: Dart 2.12 and later versions have sound null safety.
4. **Async Support**: Built-in support for asynchronous programming with async/await syntax.
5. **Collections**: Rich set of built-in collections like List, Set, and Map.
6. **Mixins**: Allows code reuse in multiple class hierarchies.

### Basic Dart Syntax:

```dart
// Variables and Data Types
var name = 'John'; // Type inference
String surname = 'Doe'; // Explicit type
int age = 30;
double height = 1.75;
bool isStudent = false;

// Lists
List<String> fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

// Maps
Map<String, String> capitals = {
  'USA': 'Washington D.C.',
  'UK': 'London',
  'Japan': 'Tokyo'
};

// Functions
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow function
int multiply(int a, int b) => a * b;

// Classes
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;

  Person(this.name, this.age);

  void introduce() {
    print('Hello, I\'m $name and I\'m $age years old.');
  }
}

// Main function
void main() {
  print('Hello, Dart!');
  
  // Using a function
  print(add(5, 3));
  
  // Using a class
  var person = Person('Alice', 25);
  person.introduce();
  
  // Null safety
  String? nullableString = null;
  print(nullableString?.length); // Safe call
  
  // Async programming
  Future<String> fetchData() async {
    // Simulating network request
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    return 'Data fetched';
  }
  
  fetchData().then((value) => print(value));
}
```

## Getting Started with Flutter

1. **Install Flutter SDK**: Download and install the Flutter SDK from the official website.
2. **Set up an IDE**: Configure VS Code or Android Studio with Flutter and Dart plugins.
3. **Create Your First App**: Use `flutter create my_app` command to create a new Flutter project.
4. **Run Your App**: Use `flutter run` in the project directory to launch your app on a connected device or emulator.
